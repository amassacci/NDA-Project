RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology provides an overall picture of the gene expression state of the cell, allowing for the determination of the relative abundance of transcripts expressed in a specific type of cell or tissue at a certain stage of development and/or under specific physiological or pathological conditions. However, once sequencing has concluded, researchers are faced with the daunting task of analyzing and interpreting the resulting data. The large volumes of data generated by RNA-Seq experiments can be overwhelming, posing significant challenges in terms of data processing and analysis. This is particularly true when researchers aim to transition from the complexity and high dimensionality of the gene count matrix (thousands of genes, numerous samples) to meaningful biological insights. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for processing this data. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) simplify complex data by transforming it into lower-dimensional spaces which not only facilitates visualization but also helps in uncovering hidden structures and patterns within the data. Clustering algorithms, including k-means and hierarchical clustering, assist in grouping genes or samples with similar expression profiles, which can reveal co-regulated genes and identify distinct subpopulations within the samples. In classification and prediction tasks, machine learning models such as Random Forest, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operation (LASSO) are employed to classify samples and predict outcomes based on gene expression profiles.


The present work conducts a comparative assessment of supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches to classify GEO GSE112509 biological samples as primary melanoma or benign melanocytic nevi based on their RNA-seq gene expression profiles. The aim is to identify the best performing algorithm for the classification task and further explore the results using functional enrichment analysis.
